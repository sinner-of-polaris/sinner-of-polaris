I’m Angel Sinagtala Realonda Magsaysay一and to make it clear, that’s my pseudonym; my real name is ■■■■■■ ■■■■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■■■■. I’m better known as Sinagtala Agbayani or Don Quixote.
       
				 .・。.・゜✭・⋇⋆✦⋆⋇・✫・゜・。.
   I welcome you to my account一whether you’re a student, a teacher, a professional, an artist, a writer, a musician, a dog, a cat, the thousand digits of π一whatever you are. But there a few things about me that you should take note of:
ㅤㅤ

ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ   
☆ I’m a minor, so please be considerate when interacting with me. I’m socially awkward but I can adapt in conversations. I somewhat lack self-awareness and I am not-so-really good with picking the right terminologies sometimes, so please educate me whenever I’m wrong. I allow anyone to communicate with me but I hope you can respect my boundaries just as much I’ll respect yours.

☆ Ladies and gents, do tell if I’m going overboard with my jokes or if my humour makes you uncomfortable. I sometimes can’t control myself with how I humour with this and that. Any strong emotion gets me quite uncontrollable (also happens outside the internet), but I manage them most of the time just fine.

☆ My social battery is inconsistent一there may be a time I’m full of enthusiasm一or I might just be dry as shit. It depends.

☆ I yap a lot... like, A LOT. Especially if we get to know each other a little too much and have the same interests. Please do tell me if I’m annoying you or if I’m oversharing too much information.

☆ I’m not open regarding religion- I DON’T BELIEVE IN RELIGION. If you’d like to discuss this with me, I suggest being respectful and comprehensive. Because it is HIGHLY UNNECESSARY to be forcing your beliefs on me and use the name of whoever God you believe in to guilt-trip and antagonize me for having a different perspective. If my status as an agnostic theist concerns you so much, then you’re not welcome here. WOE IS YOU, FUCKASS.

☆ I’ll instantly ignore/block you as I see fit. I don’t want to deal with another episode of “The Chronically Online Chronicles” or a sequel of that crap but outside the internet setting. J.F.O.O.Y.R.O.O.F (Just Fuck Off Or You’ll Receive Obliteration Of Forehead.)

☆ I have a life outside the internet. Don’t fucking expect me- FORCE me to interact with you everyday and start guilt-tripping me for "not caring about you". Bullet no. 3 also contributes to this. PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF THE STARS, PLEAAASE all I ask for is patience and respect.

☆ You may address me however you want, though I will not tolerate any insulting nicknames or pet names (‘dear’ is an exception) 𝙀𝙎𝙋𝙀𝘾𝙄𝘼𝙇𝙇𝙔 if we aren’t close friends.

☆ I’m gender fluid, pansexual, and neurodivergent. I’m a member of multiple fandoms and I do OC×OC, OC×Canon, and Yumeshipping.

☆ I heavily fictionkin Don Quixote/Sancho from Limbus Company and Polaris (as in the star that can be seen overhead in the North Pole) :3

☆ I already have a partner. Fuck off if you’re only here to beat me up.

🎠 • I’m an artist but I’m taking a break for now. I do post doodles and sketches... I just draw whenever I feel like it.

🎠 • Writing stories and world-building are kind of my thing. It’s fun (no it’s not. It’s causing me brain tumor).

🎠 • Do you... know... the... Japanese band... Mili...? Yes... that band is so peak, yeah...? They’re my inspiration for writing songs... They’re so peak I’m gonna actually disintegrate... #imustbethereasonwhy

🎠 • I like playing MMORPG/Gacha games! But don’t assume I play this or I play that. I don’t fuckin’ know or play every single Gacha game that exists globally. Don’t be a moron and go touch grass, get a job or something.

🎠 • I like reading and collecting books📚. I currently have 4 in my possession and 2 of them are my favourite: “The Little Prince” by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and “The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha” by Miguel de Cervantes.

🎠 • I also do cosplays (mostly improvised) as a hobby.
